Welcome to the Tezos Developer Documentation!
=============================================

Tezos is a distributed consensus platform with meta-consensus
capability. Tezos not only comes to consensus about the state of its ledger,
like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It also attempts to come to consensus about how the
protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade.

 - Developer documentation is available online at http://doc.tzalpha.net
 - The official Tezos website https://tezos.com/ contains more information about the
   project.
 - All development now happens on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos

The Tezos Alpha (test) network has been live and open since February 2017.
