The zeronet network
===================

The Tezos zeronet is a development network that might be broken multiple
times a day.

If you wish to experiment with Tezos we recommend you to test the
``alphanet``, which is a more stable test network.

In particular, we offer no support about the zeronet.

If you wish to play with the zeronet, you must first grab a wallet
from the faucet:

https://faucet.tzalpha.net/

This will provide you with a JSON file, named like
``tz1__xxxxxxxxx__.json``.  Once your node is synchronized, you should
run the following command to activate your wallet, where ``my_account``
is a local name you choose, and ``tz1__xxxxxxxxx__.json`` is the name
of the file you grab:

::

    $ tezos-client activate account my_account with tz1__xxxxxxxxx__.json
    Operation successfully injected in the node.
    Operation hash is 'ooGoVS5cikbTHEimTzYhQWrYqY2LeJYmfkbzoiW8KQ59jtGQaXr'.
    Waiting for the operation to be included...
    Operation found in block: BKihN2QgSAu2etftNvs8FWWhwTvZiY8P3e7H3jgdj2MCpKZXXRs
    Account my_account (tz1__xxxxxxxxx__) created with ꜩ23,454.

Or, if you use the ``zeronet.sh`` script, you should prefix the file
with ``container:`` in order to copy it into the docker image:

::

    $ ./zeronet.sh client activate account my_account with container:tz1__xxxxxxxxx__.json

Please preserve the JSON file, after each reset of the zeronet, you
will have to reactivate the wallet.

Please drink carefully and don't abuse the faucet: it only contains
30.000 wallets for a total amount of ꜩ760.000.000.
