Zeronet
=======

Zeronet is the most cutting-edge development network of Tezos. It is
restarted without notice, possibly several times a day.

If you wish to experiment with Tezos we recommend you to test
:ref:`Alphanet<alphanet>`, which is a more stable test network. We
offer no support about the zeronet.

Otherwise, the instructions to use Zeronet are the same as Alphanet,
except that ``alphanet.sh`` is replaced with ``zeronet.sh`` if you use
Docker.

You need to use the same faucet (see :ref:`faucet`) to get and
activate your wallet.
